# 21Daysofcoding
# Overview
This repository documents my journey through the 21DaysOfCoding Challenge. I took this challenge on the 25th of december as part of the #DrGViswanathan initiative by VIT Bhopal University, this initiative allows us to share our small as well as greater milestones uniquely.
During this challenge, I committed to solving at least one coding problem each day for 21 days on Platforms like Geeks for Geeks and LeetCode, fostering a consistent coding routine.

# Structure:
Each day's solution is organized in separate files, each file named after the problem.
The code is written in Java.
Clear and concise comments accompany the code for better understanding.
# Why 21DaysOfCoding?
Participating in the 21DaysOfCoding Challenge allowed me to maintain small yet effective coding streaks, establishing a consistent routine. This practice not only enhanced my problem-solving skills but also prepared me for technical interviews during placement initiatives.
