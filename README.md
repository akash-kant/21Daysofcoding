# 21Daysofcoding
# Overview
This repository documents my journey through the 21DaysOfCoding Challenge. I am continuing my 11days to 21dayscoding challenge which i updated from 25th of december as part of the #DrGViswanathan initiative by VIT Bhopal University, this initiative allows us to share our small as well as greater milestones uniquely.
During this challenge, I committed to solving at least one coding problem each day for 21 days on Platforms like Geeks for Geeks and LeetCode, fostering a consistent coding routine. This challenge is the continuous of 11dayscodingchallenge.

# Structure:
Each day's solution is organized in separate files, each file named after the problem.
The first folder is my 11dayscodechallengepart in which 11days code is present.
The code is written in Java.
Clear and concise comments accompany the code for better understanding.
# Why 21DaysOfCoding?
Participating in the 21DaysOfCoding Challenge allowed me to maintain small yet effective coding streaks, establishing a consistent routine. This practice not only enhanced my problem-solving skills but also prepared me for technical interviews during placement initiatives.
